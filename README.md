ros_kf_stack
============

The ros_kf_stack is the set of launch files, missions, and tasks that make up 
the operational code currently running on the KingFisher robot craft. Major
development of functionality and code are to be done in this folder, tested,
in simulation and then moved to the virtual machine on the base station to be
built before sync with the actual robot.
